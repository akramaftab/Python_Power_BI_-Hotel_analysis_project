# Hotel Booking Cancellations Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes over 119,000 hotel bookings to understand why and when cancellations happen. Using Python for in-depth data exploration and Power BI for interactive dashboards, this work helps hotel managers identify key risk factors and improve booking reliability to protect revenue.

***

## Process

- **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Imported booking records capturing reservation details, guest types, pricing (Average Daily Rate), countries, booking channels, and cancellation status.
  
- **([Python Analysis](
https://github.com/akramaftab/Python_Power_BI_-Hotel_analysis_project/blob/main/Hotel%20Booking%20Cancellations%20Analysis%20Report.pdf)):**  
  Explored data patterns, seasonality, guest segmentation, geographic origin, and cancellation timing using pandas and visualization libraries.
  
- **Power BI Dashboard:**  
  Created dynamic visualizations tracking ADR trends, cancellations by month, guest type, hotel location, and booking channel for easy stakeholder insights.

## Key Findings

- Nearly **37% of bookings were canceled** (44K+ out of 119K total).
- City hotels have a much higher cancellation rate (**41%**) compared to resort hotels (**28%**).
- Peak room prices in August exceed $180/night, coinciding with the highest cancellation spikes (41%+).
- **New guests make up 76%** of cancellations, while repeat guests cancel less than 20% of the time.
- **70% of cancellations originate from Portugal**, with the UK, Spain, and France adding to 90% of the issue.
- Bookings from Online Travel Agents cancel at nearly 46%, almost thrice the direct booking cancellation rate (15%).
- More than **95% of waitlisted bookings are canceled**, showing the importance of quick confirmation.
- Group bookings show higher cancellation risk at 38%.

## Business Recommendations

- **Adjust pricing and cancellation policies seasonally:** Especially in summer, introduce deposit requirements or stricter terms to secure revenue during peak ADR months.
- **engage and retain new guests:** Offer incentives, loyalty programs, and personalized follow-up to convert new visitors into repeat customers.
- **Focus on critical geographies:** Tailor payment and communication strategies for Portugal and other high-cancellation countries.
- **Promote direct bookings:** Reduce dependence on OTAs by highlighting benefits and incentivizing direct booking channels.
- **Speed up waitlist management:** Confirm bookings promptly and reduce waiting time to avoid near-certain cancellations.
- **Secure group bookings:** Require early deposits and maintain active communication to minimize group booking cancellations.
- **Use dashboards for ongoing monitoring:** Track cancellations continuously, quantify improvements, and fine-tune strategies in real time.
- **Empower staff:** Train reservation teams to proactively manage high-risk bookings based on data insights.
